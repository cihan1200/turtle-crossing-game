# Turtle Crossing Game

This is a simple arcade-style game developed using Python's Turtle graphics library. In this game, the player controls a turtle character that must cross a busy road filled with moving cars. The goal is to safely navigate across the road without getting hit by any cars.


## Features

- **Player Control**: Use the `Up Arrow` key or `W` key to move the turtle upwards.
- **Random Car Generation**: Cars are randomly generated and move from right to left across the screen.
